long description
This is the throne room of King Eurystheus. In the
center of the room the king is sitting on a golden
throne. If you go North you'll reach Nemea.This 
place is BIGLY! I mean this place is YUUUGE!
And that is an alternative fact! There's a border wall
to the South but you're free to go North to Nemea.
